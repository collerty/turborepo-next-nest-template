title: Prisma CLI
description: Get to know how to use Prisma CLI inside the project
---

## Prerequisite

Run commands from `/apps/api`.
With Bun, use `bunx` to run Prisma CLI.

---

## Create a migration

After updating `schema.prisma`:

```bash
bunx prisma migrate dev --name <name>
```

- Applies the migration to your local DB
- Regenerates the Prisma Client

---

## Deploy migrations (prod)

```bash
bunx prisma migrate deploy
```

- Runs all pending SQL migrations in `prisma/migrations`

This is what your `migrate` script does:

```json
"migrate": "bunx prisma migrate deploy"
```

---

## Push schema without migration

```bash
bunx prisma db push
```

- Updates the DB to match your schema
- Doesn’t create migration files
- Useful for local prototyping

---

## Reset the database

```bash
bunx prisma migrate reset
```

- Drops the DB
- Reapplies all migrations
- Runs seed if configured

---

## Generate Prisma Client

```bash
bunx prisma generate
```

> If you’re not using `bun dev`, which runs this automatically

---

## Migration folder

Migrations are saved in:

```
/apps/api/prisma/migrations/<timestamp>_<name>/
```

Each contains:
- `migration.sql`
- `migration_lock.toml`

---

## Typical workflow

```bash
# Edit schema
# Create migration
bunx prisma migrate dev --name <name>

# Commit
git add prisma/schema.prisma prisma/migrations/
git commit -m "migration: <name>"

# Deploy
bun run migrate
```
